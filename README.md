# Week 6

This week we looked at JSON, form data, promises and async await

## JSON

JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format used to represent structured data as text. It is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application. It uses key-value pairs.

## Form Data

Form data refers to the data entered into an HTML form, which can be submitted to a server.

## Promises

A Promise in JavaScript represents an asynchronous operation that will eventually complete, either successfully (resolved) or with an error (rejected). Promises help manage asynchronous code.

## Async/Await

sync/await is a cleaner way to work with Promises. async marks a function as asynchronous, and await pauses the execution until a Promise resolves or rejects, making asynchronous code appear more synchronous.
